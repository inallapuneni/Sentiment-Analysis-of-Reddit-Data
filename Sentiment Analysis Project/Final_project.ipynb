We went through 3 different air fryers before our current model. All of them rocked BUT the first 2 were too small basket style. The 3rd was the oven style which was bigger. We replaced it because like a week after the warranty expired the door sensor went out so we had to jam a butter knife in the door hinge when closing it to get it to see the door closed so it would start. [Our current one](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/ninja-foodi-10-in-1-smart-xl-air-fry-oven-stainless-silver/6471386.p?skuId=6471386) is probably the best we have had though.

To make buttermilk: Mix white vinegar into milk stir then let it rest for 5-10 minutes until it becomes thick and curdled 2. Whisk together melted butter oil sugar and brown sugar until light and fluffy. 3. Add eggs one at a time along with vanilla extract. 4. In a separate bowl mix the smaller amount of flour with baking powder baking soda and salt. 5. Add the dry mixture to the butter mixture in three parts alternating with the milk. Start and finish with the dry ingredients. 6. If the mixture is too runny add a little more flour.  Baking:  1. Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C) and grease a donut pan. 2. Pipe the batter into each donut mold filling about 3/4 of the mold leaving a little space at the top. 3. Bake for 10 minutes. 4. Allow the donuts to cool in the pan for a couple of minutes before transferring them to a cooling rack. 5. Let them cool down completely.  Glazing  1. In a large bowl mix sugar milk and salt until smooth. To make the glaze thinner add extra milk just a teaspoon at a time. 2. Dip your donuts into the glaze and let them firm up.

Preheat your oven to 350 degrees and grease a 9x13 casserole dish with cooking spray or a small amount of oil just before you are about to begin preparing the filling. 2. If using corn tortillas be sure to warm them up so they are pliable and dont break when you roll them.  **To Prepare the Filling**  1. For the filling using a large saute pan heat the onion in canola oil on medium heat until fragrant and translucent about 3 or 4 minutes 2. Add the diced jalapeno peppers and garlic and cook until softened about 2 more minutes. 3. Add the cream cheese press down to combine and continue cooking and stirring until the cheese is softened and incorporated into the vegetable mixture. 4. Add the ½ cup of the heavy cream to mixture and continue to cook for 2 to 3 minutesSeason the mixture with paprika salt and pepper. 5. Remove the cream cheese/vegetable mixture from the stove and fold it into the shredded chicken. Check seasoning (salt and pepper).  **To Assemble the Enchiladas and Make the Sauce**  1. Spoon the chicken mixture evenly along the center of each of the corn tortillas and top with some shredded Mexican cheese blend prior to rolling (about ½ cup for all). 2. Roll each enchilada and place them seam side down into a prepared baking casserole. 3. To make the sauce melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a saute pan and add 2 tablespoons of flour to make a roux and cook until the roux is very light tan. 4. Add 2 cups of chicken broth gradually while whisking very well to break up lumps and make it smooth. 5. Add ½ cup of heavy cream followed by 1 cup of shredded Mexican cheese blend and continue heating on low to medium until the cheese is melted. 6. Check salt and pepper and adjust if necessary. 7. Pour the sauce mixture over the enchiladas and top with more cheese.  **To Bake and Serve the Enchiladas**  1. Bake in the center of the oven until heated through and bubbly at 350 degrees about 30 minutes. 2. Top with chopped fresh cilantro and serve with picante or hot sauce - enjoy!

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot add the ground beef and cook breaking it up with a wooden spoon for 15–20 minutes until browned and cooked through. Season with salt and pepper. 2. Transfer the cooked beef to a paper towel-lined plate and discard all but 2 teaspoons of fat in the skillet.  **Cook the onion and peppers:**  1. Return the skillet to the stove over medium heat. Add the onion and both diced peppers and cook until softened about 5–7 minutes. Season lightly with salt and pepper. 2. Add the chili powder cumin garlic powder cayenne powder paprika and turmeric. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the tomato paste and mash it into the skillet. Cook for 1–3 minutes until it deepens in color. 3. Return the beef to the pot and toss to combine.  **Simmer the hot dog sauce:**  1. Pour in the beef broth and add the chili sauce. Taste and add more salt pepper and a pinch of sugar if needed. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for at least 30 minutes until thick. 2. Stir the hot dog sauce occasionally as it cooks. If the liquid evaporates too quickly add a splash or two of water. 3. If the hot dog sauce is too thin turn the heat up a touch and continue simmering until the liquid evaporates. 4. Taste and season once more before serving.  **To serve:**  1. Serve the hot dog sauce on top of your favorite hot dog. Be sure to warm the buns first! I like to microwave them so they’re soft but toast or grill them if you prefer. Serve with ketchup mustard and finely minced yellow onion on top. Enjoy!'\n",

Continue adding water 1 tbsp at a time until you have formed a soft smooth and thick dough that has the consistency of cookie dough.   \t2.\tForm 12 golf ball-sized balls and lay a moist dish towel over them so they dont dry out.   \t3.\tWarm an ungreased comal or nonstick skillet over medium heat.   \t4.\tLay a pre cut sheet of plastic on the bottom of the tortilla press and place a ball of masa on top of the plastic. Place a second sheet of plastic on top of the ball and then squeeze the press firmly so that the dough is sandwiched between the two plates. Open the press and remove the flattened masa which will be stuck between the two sheets of plastic. Place it on your left palm and use your right hand to peel off the top sheet of plastic. Then flip it over and transfer it to your right hand so that it rests in your right palm. Carefully peel off the other sheet of plastic freeing the raw tortilla.   \t5.\tGently place the raw tortilla on the preheated skillet. Watch for the edge of the tortilla to begin turning opaque a signal that it is cooking. When this happens flip to the other side and let it cook for 30 to 45 more seconds. Using the bottom of a pancake flipper gently press down on the tortilla until you hear it squeal. Flip it back to the first side and let it cook for a final 30 seconds. After the second flip it should start to puff up a sign that all of the water in the masa has evaporated and the tortilla is done.   \t6.\tAs each tortilla is finished cooking set it in a basket or a deep bowl and cover the growing stack with a dish towel to keep them warm.'\n",

The night before you make these brownies create 2 tsp dollops of Nutella and place them onto a baking sheet (or container). Freeze overnight. 2. Preheat oven to 350F (325F convection bake). Line 9 x 9” baking pan with parchment paper. Set aside.  Brownie Mixture   1. In a large bowl start by whisking together melted butter sugar and cocoa powder. Add eggs and vanilla. Whisk.

Add egg yolk and vanilla mix until well incorporated. Set aside.  Assembly  1. Spread ½ of brownie mixture onto bottom of lined baking pan. 2. Add 6-7 frozen dollops of Nutella on top of brownie layer. 3. Alternate between adding dollops of brownie and cream cheese mixture to different areas of the pan. Continue until pan is filled. 4. With a knife gently create a swirl pattern throughout the mixture. Add scattered spoonfuls of Nutella on top of swirled mixture. Lightly swirl Nutella into into the brownie/cheesecake batter to create a swirled effect. 5. Bake at 350F (or 325F convection bake) for 32-37 minutes mine were perfect after 35 min. Brownies will be firm at the edges and slightly wet in the centre. (Note: These brownies will continue to cook once you remove from oven so slightly wet dough on a toothpick while the mixture is firm at the edges is okay). 6. Let cool for 10-15 minutes before removing from pan. Brownies can be let to cool completely on a flat surface or in baking pan. Cut and Enjoy! (or chill cheesecake brownies in the fridge for 1-2 hr – then serve)'\n",

You can marinate the beef the day before or at least 30 minutes before cooking.  **2.** Fry the meat with onions on high heat to colour and transfer to the slow cooker (you can use a pot or leave it in the same pan as well) add stock to cover the meat and add one tsp of salt. Set the slow cooker on high setting for 3-4 hours (for overnight cooking keep the beef in larger pieces and set on low setting)  **3.** While the beef is cooking fry the sweet peppers on medium heat for about 10 minutes and set them aside for later.  **4.** When the beef is tender remove it from the slow cooker and let it cool for a few minutes in the cooking juices. Then remove it from the liquid and shred it with your fingers. Mix the shredded beef with the fried sweet peppers chopped parsley tomato paste chipotle paste and some of the meat cooking juices.  **5.** Brush one side of the tortilla with olive oil and place it on a heated frying pan. Add cheese to one side and top with the shredded beef mixture. Once the tortilla is golden-brown fold it over and flatten slightly.  **6.** Remove the quesadilla from the pan and cut it in half before serving. Enjoy with your favourite Mexican toppings! Enjoy!

To make this chicken dish start by mixing the marinade in a ziplock bag or container. If using a container you may need to increase the marinade by 50%. 2. Add the chicken to the marinade and massage it from the outside to coat it well. Place the bag or container in the fridge to marinate for at least 3 hours or up to 24 hours. 3. When youre ready to cook the chicken you can do it on the stove or on a BBQ. The spices in the marinade will give the chicken a nice crust and a delicious aroma. 4. After cooking the chicken let it rest for at least 3 minutes before slicing or serving. This will allow the juices to redistribute throughout the flesh rather than running out when you cut into the meat. 5. To serve place the chicken lettuce tomato slices onion yogurt sauce and flatbreads on a platter. Allow everyone to make their own wraps with the ingredients. If the chicken is larger you may want to slice it. If it is smaller you can leave it whole. Enjoy!'\n",

In a bowl combine the ginger garlic chili peppers and scallions. Add the ground chicken and season lightly with salt. Add the soy sauce sesame oil hoisin sauce and honey if using. Sprinkle in the white pepper and mix well with a spoon. Add the water and stir to combine. 2. Fry or microwave a tiny piece of the mixture until cooked through. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference.  **Fold the dumplings:**  1. First get a small bowl of water and place it on your workstation. 2. Next place a heaping teaspoon of filling in the middle of the dumpling wrapper. 3. Wet the edges with water and fold the dumpling in half. Pinch the edges to seal the dumpling closed into a half-moon shape.  **Steam pan-fry or deep-fry the dumplings:**  1. To steam: Fill your steamer pot with water and place the rack on top. Place a liner on top. Bring the water to a boil and arrange the dumplings on top. Reduce heat to medium cover and steam for 10 minutes. Use a meat thermometer to ensure the chicken has reached 165ºF. 2. To pan-fry: Dip the bottoms of the dumplings into the water to coat the bottom then dip into a bowl of sesame seeds to evenly coat the bottom. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high. Add the dumplings sesame seed side down and cook without moving for 1 minute. Pour in ¼ cup water and cover immediately. Cook for 3–4 minutes. Remove the lid and fry for an additional minute or so. 3. To deep-fry: Heat a few inches of oil in a large pot until the oil reaches 330ºF. Add dumplings in batches and deep-fry for 3–4 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.  **To serve:**  1. Make the sauce by whisking together the black vinegar chili oil sesame oil and sesame seeds. Place the sauce in a small bowl in the middle of a serving platter. Arrange the dumplings around the sauce and garnish with sliced scallions. Enjoy'\n",

            "'To start youll need some chicken breasts or thighs. We like to use boneless skinless chicken breasts for this recipe but you can use whichever type of chicken you prefer. Next youll need a few simple ingredients like flour spices and oil for frying.  To begin season the chicken with a mixture of your favorite spices. We like to use a combination of paprika garlic powder and onion powder but you can use any combination of spices that you like. Once the chicken is well coated in the spice mixture youll coat it in a mixture of flour and breadcrumbs. This helps to create a crispy crunchy texture when the chicken is fried.  Once the chicken is coated youll heat some oil in a pan over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot add the chicken to the pan and cook for 3-4 minutes on each side or until it is cooked through and crispy on the outside.  Serve the chicken with your choice of sides – we like to serve ours with a simple salad or some steamed vegetables. This delicious chicken fry is sure to be a hit with the whole family. We hope you enjoy it!

Dissolve the yeast in 1/4 cup warm water and allow approximately 5 minutes for it to become frothy. This can be done by placing the mixture in a small bowl. 2. In the same mixing bowl mix together the flour sugar salt and baking powder carefully until blended. 3. Mix together the yeast mixture milk vegetable oil and egg in a bowl to create a soft dough. 4. Knead the dough for approximately 5-7 minutes turning it out onto a floured surface until its texture becomes smooth and elastic. 5. Cover the dough in a greased bowl using a damp cloth and place in a warm spot. Allow it to rest for an hour - or until its doubled in size. 6. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). 7. Melt the butter and honey in a small saucepan over low heat then remove from the heat and stir in 1 tablespoon of warm water. The process concludes with a fully-blended mix of butter honey and water. 8. Divide the dough into small portions equivalent in size to a golf ball you will usually get between 16-18 balls. 9. Roll the dough balls into 6-inch-long ropes. 10. Take each rope fold it in half and create a spiral shape like a beehive. Twist the rope around itself and pinch the end to seal it. 11. Using parchment paper to line a baking sheet position the beehive buns in a way that leaves an adequate amount of space between each one. 12. Glaze each bun with the honey butter then top them off with a sprinkle of sesame seeds. 13. Preheat the oven then put the buns in to bake for 15-20 minutes or until they reach a golden-brown color. 14. Remove the buns from the oven when done cooking and set them on a wire rack to cool for a few minutes. Then theyll be ready to serve!'\n",

Some olive oils might.  > > Kosher salt   **Brine** > ~2 tablespoons of dried rosemary > > ~1.5 tablespoons of dried thyme > > 1 cup of light or dark brown sugar > > 8 cups of water > > 8 tablespoons Kosher salt   **Instructions** > Make the brine and set the pork inside. The pork should be covered by the water. If its not depending on the shape of the vessel just add more water and salt. 1 tbsp of salt per cup of water. Set it in the fridge for 12-24 hours 24 being ideal.  > After that time passes take out the pork and dry it real good with paper towels. Dont worry if you wipe off the rosemary or thyme. You can add more to replace what you wiped off but I didnt bother.  > Preheat the oven to 325 Fahrenheit.   > Set a stainless steel pan or Dutch oven basically any good searing vessel on medium heat with enough olive oil to coat the pan. You can pick it up and tilt it around to make the most of your oil. My big pan took about a tablespoon.   > While the pan is heating up evenly salt both sides of your pork. Dont be shy.  > When the pan is screaming hot (flick room temperature water into the pan. If it sizzles instantly its screaming hot) add your pork. Sear on each side for 2-3 minutes and dont move it around during that time. Just let it sit and get a good crust.  > Once seared on each side remove the pork and the pan from the heat and set the pork onto a clean surface. Grab the Boars Head glaze and coat the pork on all sides- top bottom and sides. All sides. Lay it on evenly but not too thick. It should just cover the pork. This stuff has a strong taste imo so dont worry if you have some leftover.  > Once coated set the pan into a roasting pan fit with a wire rack. To make cleanup easier for a reusable roasting pan line the bottom with aluminum foil.   > Tent the pork with aluminum foil and put it into the oven on a middle or lower-middle rack. Imagine a pebble covered by an upside-down bowl. The pork should be covered but not wrapped tight. Covered loosely let it roast for 30 minutes.   > After 30 minutes take the pork out and remove the foil but dont ruin its shape. Coat the pork with your apple butter. Dont bother with the bottom this time just coat the sides and top with a nice generous layer that covers the glaze which should take about half the apple butter depending on the surface area of your roast. Place back into the oven for 20 minutes without the foil tent but keep it around and intact for later.  > Take the pork out the apple butter should be quite reduced which will make a nice base layer for another layer of Apple butter. Check the porks temperature and evenly apply another layer of apple butter. Put it back in the oven. If your pork is around 130 degrees roast it for 10-13 minutes uncovered until it reaches 140 degress Fahrenheit. If its lower than 130 consider covering it with your foil hat and remove it only for the last 10-13 minutes. You may want to apply another layer for that last 10-13 minutes depending on how much the second layer reduced.  > Once the pork is 140 degrees Fahrenheit take it out and let it rest for 10 minutes. Slice it after the resting period and enjoy :)'\n",

Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Once boiling add the pearl onions and cook for 3 minutes. Drain and immediately transfer to an ice bath. Once the onions are cool to handle carefully snip off a sliver of the root end using sharp scissors. Squeeze the top of the onion to pop the onion from its skin. Continue until all the onions are peeled.  **Fry the onions:**  1. Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and sauté for 15 minutes turning occasionally until they begin to brown and soften. Season with salt.  **Prepare the sauce:**  1. Microwave 2 tablespoons plant-based butter in a bowl until melted. Add the miso paste brown sugar rice vinegar light soy sauce and chili oil and whisk until smooth. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference.  **Cook the asparagus:**  1. Add the asparagus spears to the skillet with the onions. Cook for 5 minutes until almost fork-tender.  **Finish the miso-glazed asparagus:**  1. Pour in the miso glaze and turn the heat to medium-high. As soon as it begins to bubble reduce heat and simmer for 5–7 minutes or until the glaze thickens and the asparagus is fork-tender and bright green. Taste and season. Turn off the heat.  **To serve:**  1. Arrange the asparagus and red onions on a serving platter. Garnish with sesame seeds and sliced scallions. Enjoy!'\n",

This enticing smoked salmon toast accompanied by delicate soft-boiled eggs presents a delightful lively and show-stopping dish thats effortlessly achievable for a Mothers Day brunch extravaganza.  My personal ace up the sleeve in this recipe is the homemade pea puree which imparts a burst of refreshing spring essence to every bite.  **Ingredients:**  * 2 pc bread * 2 tbsp pea puree * 2-4 slices smoked salmon * 2 pc large eggs * 1 pc lemon zested * 1-2 tbsp fresh peas (optional) * a few sprigs of fresh dill * a small bag of mixed greens * extra virgin olive oil for garnish * freshly cracked black pepper * Maldon sea salt (optional) * softened butter (optional)  &#x200B  **Instructions**  1. Fill a small pot of water high enough to submerge two eggs completely. Bring to a boil. 2. Once the water boils gently lift the eggs into the water using a spoon. Set a timer for 6 minutes \\*(see notes!). 3. After the timer goes off drain the water and run the pan under cold water for 30 seconds to stop the eggs from cooking further. 4. Crack the eggs at the bottom and carefully peel the eggs. Cut in quarters and season with sea salt and black pepper. 5. Pick out the most beautiful herbs and salad leaves from your salad mix. 6. Using your hands tear them into bite-sized pieces. Soak them in a bowl of cold water for 5 minutes and then allow them to dry on a paper towel. 7. Cook the fresh peas briefly in boiling salted water until tender. Drain rinse quickly in cold water and reserve in a small bowl. 8. Cut the salmon into thinner pieces using scissors. 9. Toast the bread until crispy around the edges and butter both of them. 10. Spread a generous amount of the pea puree on the buttered toast. 11. Add the quartered eggs then wrap the smoked salmon pieces around the eggs. 12. Garnish with the lettuce herbs fresh peas a few cracks of black pepper a little zest of lemon rind (using the Microplane) Maldon salt and olive oil.  **Notes**  If you have really sweet fresh peas you can serve them raw but quick-cooking them is usually the better option.  If you’re cooking eggs straight from your fridge then 6 minutes + 30 seconds will be better. For eggs stored at room temperature (like here in Europe) 6 minutes is perfect. These times are for large eggs. If you have smaller eggs then you’ll need to cut back on the cooking time.'\n",

            "'**Recipe here originally: [Duck Dumplings](https://newsletter.triedandtruerecipe.com/p/your-next-weekend-cooking-project)**  I based this recipe off my duck egg roll recipe which Ive made several times now and its always a huge hit. I made a few modifications to the filling based on ingredients I had readily available but the filling is fantastic with or without mushrooms.  You can also use a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store - just make sure you finely chop it.  **Roast duck:**  * 4–5 pound duck giblets neck and feet reserved for another use * 1 orange quartered * Salt and pepper  **Filling:**  * 2-inch piece of ginger peeled and minced * 4 cloves garlic peeled and minced * 3 scallions trimmed and minced * 2 Thai chili peppers trimmed and minced * 2 tablespoons hoisin sauce * 2 tablespoons thin soy sauce * 1–2 tablespoons sweet chili sauce optional to taste * ½ orange juiced * Salt if needed  **Dumplings:**  * 24–28 dumpling wrappers * Sliced scallion greens optional for garnish * Water  **Sauce:**  * ⅓ cup black vinegar * 1–2 teaspoons chili oil * 1 teaspoon sesame oil * 1 teaspoon sesame seeds  **Prepare the duck:**  1. Preheat the oven to 350ºF. 2. Line a roasting pan with foil. Place a raised rack in the pan and set aside. 3. Pat the duck dry and season it all over with salt and pepper. 4. Stuff the cavity with the orange wedges. Truss the legs with kitchen twine.  **Roast the duck:**  1. Place the duck on top of the raised rack and transfer it to the oven for 2 hours. 2. Remove the duck from the oven. Using a sharp knife create a few shallow slits in the skin across the breast and around the thighs. This will allow the fat to fully render. Be careful not to cut the meat too much. You just need 6–8 slits all over the duck particularly around the fatty area of the legs and breasts. 3. Return the duck to the oven for 1 hour. 4. Remove the duck from the oven and let cool as you prepare the filling.  **Prepare the filling:**  1. Gather the minced ginger garlic scallions and Thai chili peppers in a bowl. Add the hoisin sauce soy sauce orange juice and sweet chili sauce if you like.  **Shred the duck:**  1. Once the duck is cool enough to handle pick the meat from the bones. Avoid any meat that feels very sinewy. You can keep as much of the crispy skin as you like for the dumplings particularly the skin around the breasts thighs and legs. I discard the skin on the back of the duck. Reserve the carcass for stock if you like. 2. Place the meat and skin on a cutting board and finely dice. Transfer to the bowl of aromatics and toss to combine. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference. Your filling is finished and youre ready to make dumplings!  **Fold the dumplings:**  1. First get a small bowl of water and place it on your workstation. 2. Place a heaping teaspoon of filling in the middle of the dumpling wrapper. 3. Wet the edges with water and fold the dumpling in half. Pinch the edges to seal the dumpling closed into a half-moon shape. 4. You can crimp and pinch the edges as you seal it but it takes practice!  **Steam pan-fry or deep fry the dumplings:**  1. To steam: fill your steamer pot with water and place the rack on top. Place a liner on top. Bring the water to a boil and arrange the dumplings on top. Reduce heat to medium cover and steam for 10 minutes. 2. To pan-fry: Dip the bottoms of the dumplings into the water just to coat the bottom then dip into a bowl of sesame seeds to evenly coat the bottom. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high. Add the dumplings sesame seed side down and cook without moving for 1 minute. Pour in ¼ cup water and cover immediately. Cook for 3–4 minutes. Remove the lid and fry for an additional minute or so. 3. To deep-fry: Heat a few inches of oil in a large pot until the oil reaches 330ºF. Add dumplings in batches and deep-fry for 3–4 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.  **To serve:**  1. Make the sauce by whisking together the black vinegar chili oil sesame oil and sesame seeds. Place the sauce in a small bowl in the middle of a serving platter. Arrange the dumplings around the sauce and garnish with sliced scallions. Enjoy!'\n",

Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Once boiling add a generous pinch of salt along with the pasta. Cook until 1–2 minutes shy of al dente. Scoop out ⅓ cup of the pasta cooking water and set aside. Drain the pasta.  **Prepare the sauce:**  1. Heat 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Once hot add the onion and cook for 5–7 minutes stirring occasionally. 2. Melt the butter into the onions. Once bubbly add the garlic and crushed red pepper and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. 3. Add the tomato paste and cook mashing it into the onions for 3–4 minutes until it begins to deepen in color and stick to the bottom of the pot. Be careful not to burn the garlic! 4. Pour in the vodka and bring the sauce to a boil. Stir in the water sun-dried tomatoes and chickpeas. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat and simmer for 15–20 minutes adding water as needed if the liquid evaporates too quickly.  **Sauce the pasta:**  1. After the sauce finishes simmering taste and just the seasonings to your preference. 2. Pour in the heavy cream and turn the heat to medium. As soon as the sauce bubbles add the cooked pasta and toss to coat for 2 minutes. Next add the pasta cooking water to loosen up the sauce to your preferences. Once the pasta is completely coated turn off the heat. Taste and season once more.  **To serve:**  1. Spoon the pasta onto a serving platter and garnish with fresh basil and parmesan cheese.

Before starting calibrate your thermometer by boiling water in a pot. 2. Place the thermometer into the boiling water and note the temperature reading which should be around 212°F (100°C).  Maple Syrup Candy:  1. Pour the maple syrup into a large heavy-bottomed pan. 2. Heat the maple syrup to 300°F (149°C) which is 88°F (49°C) above the boiling point of water. Be sure to check the boiling water temperature beforehand for accuracy.  Shaping and cooling Maple Syrup Candy  1. As the syrup heats prepare your candy molds or line a baking sheet with parchment paper. 2. Once the syrup reaches the desired temperature remove the pan from heat and quickly pour the mixture into the prepared molds or onto the lined baking sheet. 3. Allow the candy to harden and cool for about 20 minutes. 4. Remove the candy from the molds or break it into pieces if you used the baking sheet method. 5. Share and enjoy your homemade maple syrup candy!  Cant wait to see you next week for more exciting recipes!  Sandrine )'\n",

Preheat oven to 325°F. 2. Unwrap the ham and place it in a large baking dish. I also decided to pour all the juices from the bag in the dish to help keep it juicy. 3. If you have a spiral-cut ham there’s nothing else to do. Otherwise make ¼″ deep cuts in a diamond pattern all over the ham surface (this will allow the juices from the brown sugar ham glaze to drip down inside later). 4. Place in the oven and bake. 5. A ham will take about 1 to 1-½ hours to cook through. After 1 hour check the temperature by inserting a meat thermometer in the thickest part (being careful not to touch the bone). The ham is ready when the internal temperature has reached 130°F. 6. At about the 1-hour mark start making the brown sugar ham glaze. 7. Melt butter in a small pan over medium heat.  8. Once the butter has melted add all the other ingredients and whisk together. 9. Bring to a simmer whisking occasionally and cook for about 5 minutes.  10. Immediately remove from heat and let cool for 5 to 10 minutes. 11. Check the internal temperature of your ham (the ham is finished cooking when it has reached 130°F). 12. When it’s getting close to that point but has about a half hour left baste half of the brown sugar ham glaze onto the ham.  13. Fifteen minutes later brush on the remaining ham glaze and let the ham finish cooking until it has reached 130°F. 14. Serve and enjoy!'\n",

Black Pepper (more to taste)   2 Tbsp. Dried Parsley  Nutmeg (optional)  Mochiko Sweet Rice Flour    **Method:**  Heat olive oil in a pan over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Stir in garlic. Cook until garlic just barely begins to brown around the edges. Whisk in about 2 Tbsp. of Mochiko or enough to absorb the oil. Add oat milk onion powder salt pepper and parsley. Whisk until lumps of Mochiko disappear. Add the tiniest pinch of nutmeg. Taste for seasoning and adjust as desired. Heat to a bare simmer and whisk in more Mochiko 1 Tbsp. at a time until desired thickness is reached. Sauce will thicken slightly when cooled so aim for something around 85-90% your desired thickness. Toss with 8 oz. of your favorite pasta and enjoy!'\n",
